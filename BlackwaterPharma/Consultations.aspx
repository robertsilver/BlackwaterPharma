			More Information ...</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>FREE NHS Medicines Use Review</strong>:
			All patients with long-term conditions taking medication (and who have had their
			medication dispensed at one of our pharmacies for at least 3 months) can have an
			annual Medicines Use Review. The review takes place in private with a suitably accredited
			pharmacist who will help you get the best out of your medicines. The review lasts
			about 20-30 minutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>FREE Blood Pressure Monitoring:</strong> Come and
			have your blood pressure checked. Many people are unaware they have high blood pressure,
			and the risks associated with it remaining untreated. The pharmacist will also help
			you with lifestyle advice to help reduce it, if necessary.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>FREE Diabetes Screening:</strong> Many people
			who develop diabetes are unaware they had it, possibly for years before first diagnosis.
			A simple blood test will help identify the disease, reducing the possibility of
			long term complications.
		</p>
		<p>
			</a><strong>FREE* NHS Smoking Cessation Service:</strong>
			Want to give up smoking? Come and talk to one of our qualified Smoking Cessation
			Advisors who will help you &ldquo;kick the habit&rdquo;, with motivational and Nicotine
			Replacement Therapy support. (*chargeable to NHS charge-paying patients)</p>
		<p>
			<strong></a>Health Advice and Self-Care:</strong> The
			pharmacist and our trained assistants are available for advice on all medicines
			and minor ailments, in private if required. We can also give you advice on how to
			live a healthy life, for example, advice on how to stop smoking or healthy diets.
			We can direct you to other sources of advice and assistance if we cannot help you
			ourselves.</p>
		<p>
			<strong></a>Prescription MOTs:</strong> You can make an appointment
			with our pharmacist to discuss how you are getting on with your regular medicines.
			It will allow you to learn more about your medicines and ask any questions you may
			have, and if you are having difficulties taking your medicines our team may be able
			to assist. Ask for more details on this service.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Holiday Healthcare:</strong> We can advise
			on medical requirements for travellers, including anti-malaria treatments.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Emergency Hormonal Contraception</strong>: EHC
			is available, if appropriate, following confidential discussion with the pharmacist.
			Talk to the pharmacist without delay, as this is only available up to 72 hours after
			the event.
