		Why can't I throw my medicines away myself ?</h1>
	<p class="para_last">
		By throwing your old medicines down the toilet you can effect the ecology of the
		water system. If everyone threw their old medicines down the toilet, the water system
		would become polluted by all the antibiotics, hormones and other drugs in your medicine
		cupboard.</p>
	<h1 class="ReturningYourUnwantedMedicinesTwo">
		Why should I bring my medicines back to the Pharmacist ?</h1>
	<p>
		So that your unwanted medicine can be disposed of in a safe way. All returned medicines
		will be incinerated.</p>

		in any way.</p>
	<h1 class="ReturningYourUnwantedMedicinesTwo">
		Will my old medicines go to third world countries ?</h1>
	<p class="para_last">
		No, for many reasons this is impossible. It is not possible to predict the need
		of the population to which they would be sent. Also, the identity, quality or security
		of the medicines cannot be guaranteed.</p>
